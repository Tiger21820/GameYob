## Info about GameYob Branches

The master branch of this repository (https://github.com/Drenn1/GameYob)
currently contains the source for an unfinished overhaul of GameYob after
release 0.5. In particular, this overhaul allows for the emulation of multiple
gameboys, in order to improve wireless link cable emulation by emulating both
gameboys on both systems. It also facilitated the 3DS port (and SDL for
testing purposes).

However, because speed suffered slightly and kinks were never fully worked out,
no public releases were made with this branch. Updates were instead done on the
"v0.5-hotfix" branch to fix issues with GameYob version 0.5.

Also, despite some residual 3DS code in this repository, SteveIce's fork for the
3DS version had far more work done on it. That repository is down now, but
a fork can be found here: https://github.com/ZopharsDomain/GAMEBOYC-3DS-GameYob

The 3DS version had its own kinks, which means you may still prefer to use the
DS version even on a 3DS. It is recommended to install it using the DSiWare CIA
file provided with the newer releases of GameYob DS.
